# Hi there 👋

💻 Love Coding ❤️ as much as I do? Let's talk about how awesome⚡they are!

💼 I've honed my skills in a variety of technologies, including React, JavaScript, CSS, jQuery, Java, C, and Python. I'm particularly enthusiastic about open-source projects and looking for good-first-issue to start my journey on opensource.

🔬 Currently, I'm eagerly exploring new opportunities to apply my skills and gain real-world experience. Whether it's web development, software engineering, or contributing to exciting projects, I'm excited to take on challenges and continue learning.

🌟 Let's connect! I'm always open to networking, collaborating, and learning from fellow tech enthusiasts and professionals.
